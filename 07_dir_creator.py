# Script: 07 - Directory Creation
# Author: Robert Gregor
# Date of latest revision: 152030FMAR23

# Objectives
    # Create a Python script that generates all directories, sub-directories and files for a user-provided directory path
        # Script must ask the user for a file path and read a user input string into a variable
        # Script must use the os.walk() function from the os library
        # Script must enclose the os.walk() function within a python function that hands it the user input file path

# Stretch Goals
    # Instead of the os module, utilize the subprocess module instead
        # Refer to python.org for how this can be achieved

# Import libraries

import os

# Declaration of variables

### Read user input here into a variable

# Declaration of functions

### Declare a function here

for (root, dirs, files) in os.walk("testdir"):
    ### Add a print command here to print ==root==
    print(root)
    ### Add a print command here to print ==dirs==
    print(dirs)
    ### Add a print command here to print ==files==
    print(files)

# Main

### Pass the variable into the function here

# End
