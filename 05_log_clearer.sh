# Date of latest revision: 121830FMAR23

# Objectives - Write a log clearing bash script
    # Write a bash script that performs the following tasks:
        # Print to screen file size of log files before compression
        # Compress contents of log files listed below to backup directory
            # /var/log/syslog
            # /var/log/wtmp
        # File name should contain time stamp with following format -YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
            # Example: /var/log/backups/syslog-20220928081457.zip
        # Clear contents of log file
        # Print to screen file size of compressed file
        # Compare size of compressed files to size of original log files

# Stretch Goals - How can your script be used to clear tracks?
    # Watch [How To Clear Tracks & Logs On Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgquV_OA-lU)
        # Using knowledge of various logs described in video, expand script; what other system logs can you clear?
    # In comments per log cleared, explain what the log tracks in the Ubuntu system. Why is this log important?
