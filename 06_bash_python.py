# Script: 06 - Bash in Python
# Author: Robert Gregor
# Date of latest revision: 152030FMAR23

# Objectives
    # Create a Python script that executes a few bash commands successfully
        # Indicate in comments how you achieved this
    # Requirements:
        # Python module “os” must be utilized
        # At least three variables must be declared in Python that contain results of bash operations
        # Python function print() must be used at least three times
    # Include execution of the following bash commands inside your Python script:
        # whoami / ip a / lshw -short

# Stretch Goals
    # Instead of the os module, utilize the subprocess module instead
        # Refer to python.org for how this can be achieved
