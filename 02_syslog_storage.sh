# Objectives - Create a bash script that:
    # Copies /var/log/syslog to the current working directory
    # Appends the current date and time to the filename

# Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)
    # Include in your bash script some timestamped echo statements telling the user what is happening at each stage of the script.

# Main

clear

# Declares cur_dtg variable which stores current date with specific format

cur_dtg=$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%T)

# Creates .txt file with current DTG appended to cur_dtg variable for file name in current working directory
    # Copies syslog content into .txt file

cp /var/log/syslog "$cur_dtg-sys_log.txt"

# Prints time stamped comment declaring action completed

echo $(date) -- "/var/log/syslog copied into current working directory"
echo ""

# Uses "space bar to continue" for future potential functionality

read -n 1 -r -s -p $'Press space bar to continue...\n'
echo ""

# End
